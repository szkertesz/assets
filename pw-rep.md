Title: Enhancing Multimedia Content Delivery on Our Website: Technical Challenges and Solutions

Summary

In our project, we utilized Brightcove, a comprehensive video hosting platform, built upon the open-source library, Video.js, to deliver high-quality multimedia content to our users. Brightcove’s rich media streaming capabilities met our content delivery needs, but we encountered several technical challenges while implementing it across various platforms, particularly on iOS devices. This report outlines the issues we faced and how we resolved them to improve cross-platform video playback consistency, reduce code redundancy, and enhance user experience.

Challenges Encountered

    Fullscreen Playback on iOS Devices
    On iOS devices, the native video player automatically opens in fullscreen mode by default. This behavior caused a collision with our modal-based video player solution, leading to several issues:
        The native iOS player displayed on top of our custom modals, disrupting the user interface.
        Parallel playback of multiple videos occurred, causing overlapping audio and inconsistent user experiences.
        Platform discrepancies emerged, as video playback behavior varied significantly between iOS and other operating systems.

    Code Redundancy and Player Collisions
    Our original implementation involved separate video playback setups for different components, leading to redundant code across the system. Some of the major problems included:
        Multiple components with isolated playback functionalities resulted in code duplication.
        Player collisions occurred when different components referenced the same video ID, causing unexpected behavior.
        It was challenging to maintain consistent functionality across various platforms due to this fragmented approach.

    Click Event Handling on iOS Devices
    iOS devices did not properly respond to click events as they would on other platforms.

As a result, some users experienced non-responsive video players or difficulty in interacting with multimedia content.

Solutions Implemented

    Customizing iOS Fullscreen Behavior
    To address the fullscreen issue on iOS, we customized the Video.js configuration to override the native player behavior. By controlling the video playback within our modal windows, we ensured that:
        The native iOS player was suppressed, allowing our custom modal to remain the primary interface for video playback.
        Only one video could play at a time, eliminating the issue of parallel playback.
        Consistent functionality was achieved across different platforms by unifying the video experience for users on desktop and mobile devices.

    Centralized Multimedia Handling
    We refactored our video player architecture by implementing a centralized multimedia handling system:
        All video-enabled components now utilize a single, standardized video player instance to handle multimedia content, reducing code redundancy.
        A unique video ID management system was introduced to avoid player collisions, ensuring that video components do not interfere with each other.
        This centralized approach has streamlined development and maintenance, making it easier to ensure cross-platform consistency.

    Switching to Touch Events on iOS
    To handle the issue of unresponsive click events on iOS devices, we transitioned to the touchstart event for triggering interactions. By detecting touch interactions, we:
        Improved the responsiveness of the video players on iOS devices.
        Ensured smoother user interactions, allowing users to interact seamlessly with video content across all touch-enabled devices.

Conclusion

By addressing these technical challenges, we improved the overall user experience and consistency of multimedia content delivery across platforms. Our centralized multimedia handling approach reduced code redundancy, while the adjustments made for iOS-specific behavior and event handling ensured smoother interactions. Going forward, these solutions will facilitate easier maintenance and future enhancements to our video player functionality.
