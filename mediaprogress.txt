Comprehensive Performance Measurement Guide for Adobe Analytics Implementation Refactoring

This report provides detailed guidance for measuring performance impacts when refactoring Adobe Analytics implementation from Launch rules to direct call methods (_satellite.track) within an AEM application's media player components. The measurements focus on JavaScript execution performance, network performance of analytics scripts, and memory and resource utilization.
JavaScript Execution Performance Measurements

JavaScript execution performance is critical when refactoring analytics implementations, as it directly impacts user experience and page responsiveness. The following measurements will help quantify the execution efficiency of both implementations.
CPU Profiling
Setup and Execution

    Chrome DevTools Performance Panel:

        Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)

        Navigate to the Performance tab

        Click the record button (⏺️)

        Interact with the media player (play, pause, seek)

        Stop recording after 10-15 seconds

        Save the profile with a descriptive name including the implementation type

Programmatic Performance API Measurements:

    Implement timing measurements around key functions:

javascript
// Before refactoring
performance.mark('analytics-start');
// Execute analytics tracking code (Launch rule)
performance.mark('analytics-end');
performance.measure('analytics-execution', 'analytics-start', 'analytics-end');

// After refactoring
performance.mark('direct-call-start');
_satellite.track('mediaPlay'); // Direct call method
performance.mark('direct-call-end');
performance.measure('direct-call-execution', 'direct-call-start', 'direct-call-end');

    Collect these measurements for multiple media player interactions

Analysis Methodology

    Compare Execution Times:

        Extract total execution time for each implementation

        Analyze function call patterns and durations

        Compare the call stack depth between implementations

Create Performance Benchmarks:

    Measure typical media player interactions:

        Play event execution time

        Pause event execution time

        Progress tracking execution time

        Complete event execution time

    Test each interaction 10+ times to establish reliable averages

JavaScript Execution Tracing
Setup and Execution

    Configure Chrome Tracing:

        Launch Chrome with the --enable-benchmarking flag

        Use the chrome://tracing interface to capture detailed event traces

        Focus on the "JavaScript" and "V8" categories

        Record traces for identical user flows in both implementations

Analyze Script Parsing & Execution:

    Measure script parse time differences

    Compare JavaScript compilation time

    Evaluate execution time of analytics-related functions

    Document main thread blocking duration during analytics events

Network Performance (Analytics Script Execution)

Request Analysis
Setup and Execution

    Chrome DevTools Network Panel:

        Open the Network tab in DevTools

        Enable the "Preserve log" option

        Filter requests to show only analytics-related traffic (filter: "adobe" or relevant domains)

        Perform standard media player operations (play, pause, seek, complete)

        Export HAR files for both implementations for comparison

Beacon and Request Timing Measurements:

    Record the following for each analytics beacon:

        Request size (payload)

        Request timing (TTFB, download time)

        Request frequency during media playback

        Number of concurrent requests during key interactions

Analysis Methodology

    Compare Request Patterns:

        Create a table tracking:

            Total number of analytics requests during standard media session

            Average request size (in bytes)

            Average request latency

            Request timing distribution (are requests clustered or evenly spread?)

Evaluate Payload Efficiency:

    Analyze request payloads for both implementations

    Compare data redundancy between requests

    Measure compression ratio and transmission efficiency

    Document any differences in data structure or content

Analytics Data Delivery Timing
Setup and Execution

    Resource Timing API Implementation:

javascript
// Monitor analytics endpoint performance
const analyticsObserver = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  const entries = list.getEntries().filter(entry => 
    entry.name.includes('analytics') || 
    entry.name.includes('metrics') || 
    entry.name.includes('adobe'));
  
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    console.log(`${entry.name}: ${entry.duration}ms`);
    // Log or store these measurements
  });
});

analyticsObserver.observe({entryTypes: ['resource']});

    Deploy this code in both implementations to track analytics network performance

Server-Side Validation:

    Work with the analytics team to confirm data receipt timing

    Compare server processing time for both implementations

Memory & Resource Utilization

Memory usage is a critical aspect of web application performance, especially for long-running media sessions. These measurements help quantify the memory efficiency of both implementations.
Heap Memory Profiling
Setup and Execution

    Chrome DevTools Memory Panel:

        Navigate to the Memory tab in DevTools

        Select "Heap snapshot" as the profiling type

        Take snapshots at key points:

            Before media player initialization

            After initialization, before playback

            During playback (after several tracking events)

            After media completion

        Save snapshots with descriptive names

Programmatic Memory Measurements:

    Implement the performance.measureMemory() API (where supported):

javascript
async function measureMemoryAtKey(eventName) {
  try {
    const result = await performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory();
    console.log(`Memory at ${eventName}:`, result.bytes / (1024 * 1024), 'MB');
    // Store this data for comparison
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Memory measurement failed:', error);
  }
}

// Call at key points in media playback

    Capture memory measurements during various media player events

Analysis Methodology

When evaluating the performance of your refactored Adobe Analytics implementation on an AEM frontend, you should measure key performance metrics both before and after the refactoring. Here are the most relevant areas to focus on:
1. Page Load Performance

Since Adobe Analytics tracking scripts can impact page load times, measure:

    Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Time taken to load the largest visible element.
    First Contentful Paint (FCP): When the first part of the page becomes visible.
    Total Blocking Time (TBT): Measures how much time scripts block user interaction.
    Time to Interactive (TTI): When the page becomes fully interactive.

🔧 Tools: Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPageTest
2. Network Performance (Analytics Script Execution)

Evaluate how your analytics scripts affect network requests:

    Number of requests made by analytics scripts (reduce unnecessary calls)
    Total request payload size (check if tracking calls are optimized)
    Time taken to send tracking requests (check delay in event sending)
    Impact on page load waterfall (does it block or delay other resources?)

🔧 Tools: Chrome DevTools (Network Tab), Adobe Debugger, WebPageTest
3. JavaScript Execution Performance

Since analytics scripts run JavaScript logic on the frontend:

    Execution time of Adobe Analytics script
    Impact on CPU usage (especially on low-end devices)
    JavaScript blocking time (how much it delays interactivity)
    Main thread activity (check if analytics code competes with rendering)

🔧 Tools: Chrome DevTools (Performance Tab), Lighthouse, Web Vitals
4. Data Layer & Event Tracking Accuracy

    Ensure all required events are still tracked correctly (compare event logs before & after)
    Accuracy of data collected (compare data layer variables before and after)
    Duplication of tracking requests (eliminate redundant hits)
    Latency in event tracking (how quickly events are sent after user actions)

🔧 Tools: Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger, Adobe Launch, Browser Console
5. Memory & Resource Utilization

    Memory consumption before vs. after (check if memory leaks are introduced)
    Garbage collection behavior (ensure old event listeners are removed)
    Impact on page responsiveness (scrolling, clicks should not be delayed)

🔧 Tools: Chrome DevTools (Memory Tab), Performance Profiling
6. SEO & Core Web Vitals Impact

    Ensure analytics scripts do not block rendering
    Avoid excessive inline scripts that affect SEO
    Check if refactored scripts introduce console errors

🔧 Tools: Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools

Step-by-Step Guide for Network Performance (Analytics Script Execution)
Step 1: Open Chrome DevTools and Navigate to the Network Tab

    Open your AEM application in Google Chrome.
    Open Chrome DevTools:
        Windows/Linux: Press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I
        macOS: Press Cmd + Option + I
    Click on the "Network" tab.
    In the Filter Bar, type "b/ss" to isolate Adobe Analytics requests.
    (Adobe Analytics requests usually have "b/ss" in the URL.)

Step 2: Measure the Number of Adobe Analytics Requests

    Reload the page (Ctrl + R) and observe all Adobe Analytics tracking requests.
    Count the total number of tracking requests.
    Compare this count before and after refactoring to check if redundant requests have been eliminated.

Step 3: Analyze Request Size and Payload

    Click on each tracking request to inspect the Headers & Payload.
    Look for:
        The payload size (check the Content-Length in the headers).
        Unnecessary or duplicate parameters being sent.
        Any missing or incorrect data points compared to the old implementation.

Step 4: Measure Time Taken for Tracking Calls

    Look at the Timing tab for each request:
        Waiting (TTFB): Time spent waiting for the response.
        Time to Finish: Total time the request takes.
        Impact on Page Load: Check if these requests delay other resources in the Waterfall View.
    Compare timing data before vs. after refactoring to ensure no increase in delays.

Step 5: Evaluate Whether Requests Are Blocking Other Resources

    Check the Waterfall View in the Network Tab.
    Look at the order of requests:
        Are tracking calls blocking essential resources (CSS, images, scripts)?
        Do they load asynchronously, or do they delay rendering?

✅ Best Practice: Adobe Analytics scripts should load asynchronously to avoid blocking page rendering.
Step-by-Step Guide for JavaScript Execution Performance
Step 1: Open the Chrome Performance Profiler

    Open your AEM application in Google Chrome.
    Open Chrome DevTools (F12).
    Navigate to the "Performance" tab.

Step 2: Record JavaScript Execution

    Click the "Record" button (red circle at the top left).
    Perform typical user interactions that trigger Adobe Analytics tracking (e.g., clicking buttons, navigating).
    Let it run for 5-10 seconds and then click Stop.

Step 3: Analyze JavaScript Execution Time

    Look at the Main Thread section.
    Identify Adobe Analytics-related scripts (usually named s_code.js, AppMeasurement.js, or custom tracking scripts).
    Look at:
        Long tasks (yellow bars) – Do Adobe Analytics scripts contribute to high execution time?
        Execution time per function – Identify slow functions inside your tracking scripts.

Step 4: Check for JavaScript Blocking Time

    Scroll down to the Bottom-Up View.
    Check for Total Blocking Time (TBT).
    Look for tracking scripts consuming a large share of CPU.

✅ Best Practice: Analytics scripts should run efficiently in the background without significantly increasing JavaScript execution time.
Step 5: Measure Memory & Garbage Collection

    Navigate to the "Memory" tab in Chrome DevTools.
    Click "Take Snapshot" and analyze memory usage.
    Perform user interactions and take another snapshot.
    Check if Adobe Analytics scripts create memory leaks (increased memory usage over time without releasing resources).
