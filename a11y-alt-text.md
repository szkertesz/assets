I always wanted to do a _good_ job. I don’t like letting people down, and interfaces that people can’t actually use are… not good.
(But that requires a cultural shift, and isn’t easy, especially since most folks still consider ‘design’ to be separate from behavior and interaction.)
Of course, the benefits are plenty too: fewer embarrassing social media chastisements, lawsuits, and generally unhappy customers. Broadly accessible interfaces help many and hinder none. Inaccessible interfaces piss off people with disabilities, but also offer a less ergonomic experience to folks in general.
inclusive design is _good_ design.
But that button first needs to be semantic, responsive, clearly labeled, translatable, and easy to press.

We're looking out the user. Of course with things like this
12:26
where we present information in bad ways using the wrong methods and and reduce the amount
12:35
of information because we're worried about clutter because we care more about how things
12:41
look and how tidy they are than how good they are at actually explaining what's going on.

The Code, and our culture, which is grounded in MS’s core values, guide all of our actions.

- Do the Right Thing - (...) Act with integrity
Does my action demonstrate a commitment to delivering first-class business in a first-class way?
Could my action damage my or MS’s reputation, or embarrass me or MS?

- Commit to Diversity and Inclusion - (...) Challenge behavior counter to our culture of inclusion
